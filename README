This is a repository for the MPI-based C++ code to generate a phase diagram for the Domany-Kinzel-like model of a two-dimensional range expansion. 



Source code file list

phase.cpp: main program
rancombi.cpp: template definition for random number generators 
randomc.h: header file for random number generators
ranrotw.cpp: random number generator RANROT type W implementation
ranrotb.cpp: random number generator RANROT type B implementation


The code is complied via "mpic++ phase.cpp".  The random number generator files must be included for proper linking.  The local configuration must also support the MPI libraries.
